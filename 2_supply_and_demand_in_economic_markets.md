# Supply and Demand in Economic Markets

## Your friendly neighborhood espresso market

Imagine a neighborhood of cafés, all serving espresso. What a wondrous place to live! The baristas make as many espresso shots as customers buy. More specifically, at any given time, the rate at which baristas supply espresso shots (e.g., in shots per hour) is always equal to the rate at which customers demand them.

For reasons that will become apparent later, we will assume that all cafés serve identical espresso and offer an identical experience to customers. Because the cafés' offerings are the same and they are conveniently located within the same neighborhood, the only thing that would set them apart in the eyes of customers is their prices.

But if a café tries to undercut its neighbors, the other cafés will follow suit if the lower price is sustainable in order to stay competitive. And if a café raises its price to increase its profit margin, others will be able to do the same. For a given time, place, and offering, there is one stable price. Different cafés may have different operating costs&mdash;perhaps a café has a more expensive supplier of espresso beans&mdash;but they tend to charge the same price per espresso shot and pocket the difference.

Customers' demand for espresso shots is based on how much the cafés charge for each one; there will be fewer customers if the cafés charge more and vice-versa. Thus, the rate at which customers buy espresso is a function of the price per espresso shot. This function is called the demand curve, which models buyer behavior and is generally monotonically decreasing. The demand curve changes with time; for example, demand for espresso is greatest in the morning.

If the cafés have to make more espresso, they will have to purchase more espresso beans. They will have to call upon additional baristas to help, or in general have to pay each barista more per hour&mdash;more per shot, essentially. In other words, the cafés have a cost per espresso shot, which is reflected in the price they charge for each one. However, the cafés' price per shot is not constant. If the cafés are overwhelmed with customers, they may charge more for each espresso shot to take advantage of the situation and make more profit per shot. The cafés may have to augment their baristas' hourly wages with bonus pay to keep them happy. In order to meet the demand, the cafés may also have to bust out their older, less efficient espresso machines from their back rooms that use more espresso beans per shot. On the other hand, if the cafés are having a slow day, they may reduce their price and sacrifice some profit per espresso shot in order to make the most of the low demand. This is called dynamic pricing. The price is a function of the rate at which espresso shots are being sold. This function is called the supply curve, which models seller behavior and is generally monotonically increasing.<!-- * -->

## The market clearing process

The above principles are true not just for a neighborhood of cafés but for any capitalist market. These basic tenets of economics are the principles of supply and demand. They apply wherever a quantity of a good is exchanged at a price per unit of that good.

The allocation of buyers to sellers (customers to cafés) is a process called *clearing the market*. This determines the quantity of goods that gets exchanged in the market, and at what price. The price is known as the *market price* or *market-clearing price*. A capitalist market rewards sellers who charge a low price, giving them priority over other sellers. At the same time, a capitalist market rewards buyers who are willing to pay a high price, giving them priority over other buyers. It follows that we can model the market clearing process by allocating an increasing quantity of goods to the buyers and sellers, starting with the buyers who are willing to pay the most and the sellers who are willing to charge the least, until the buying price equals the selling price.

We can represent this model graphically (or mathematically) by plotting the supply and demand curves. The market-clearing price and quantity are dictated by where the two curves intersect.

Obviously there is no regulatory body that allocates customers to cafés, no economist planted in town square finding the intersection between the supply and demand curves. Your friendly neighborhood espresso market clears itself. Cafés try to charge the highest price that the optimal number of customers are willing to pay, and customers naturally seek out the lowest price that cafés are willing to charge; the two sides meet somewhere in the middle.

## The electricity market

The principles of supply and demand are so universal that they apply to the power grid when operated as an electricity market. In this case, the good is not espresso shots but megawatt-hours of electricity&mdash;energy for machines, rather than for humans. The unit of measurement is not espresso shots per hour but megawatt-hours per hour&mdash;so, just megawatts. In an electricity market, the rate at which electricity is supplied (the production, or generation) is always equal to the rate at which it is demanded (the consumption, or load). In the café analogy, generators are espresso machines and loads are customers. Everything that we've discussed so far in terms of cafés applies to the electricity market.

We assumed before that all cafés served identical espresso. In other words, we assumed that espresso is a *commodity*&mdash;a good that varies little between sellers and that buyers need not be picky about. Obviously this isn't true about espresso in the real world! Examples of commodities include wheat, crude oil, and...electricity! Indeed, all electrons are created equal. Electricity may be produced from a variety of energy sources (nuclear, hydro, and so on) and travel varying distances to get to your home, but there is no differentiating between a nuclear-generated electron and a hydro-generated electron. People care about the origin and locality of their food more than that of their electricity. Yes, some people care about the environmental sustainability of their electricity&mdash;I among them&mdash;but we cannot choose between sustainable and unsustainable electrons. We can only choose to consume electricity at times of day when there is a higher proportion of sustainable electrons in the mix. But, at a given time, all electrons are equal.

Previously we discussed the market clearing process. The electricity market must be cleared like any other, but unlike a neighborhood espresso market, it cannot feasibly clear itself. There are two reasons for this.

First of all, there is no buffer between production and consumption. If cafés are busy, customers can feasibly wait for up to several minutes between placing their orders and receiving their espresso. Alternately, the cafés can prepare extra espresso shots while morning demand is still ramping up, to reduce customer wait times. But this does not work in the electricity market. When you turn on your kettle, you don't have to wait even a second for power. You just take. The grid cannot ramp up in advance of everyone turning on their kettles in the morning because, traditionally, there is no way to store that extra power.

The second reason for which the electricity market cannot clear itself is that resources are pooled. When you want espresso, you go to one café and talk to one barista who fulfills your order. But when you want to turn on your electric kettle at home, you don't call up a generator and ask them to ramp up by a couple kilowatts. There is a disconnect between the demand (you, or rather, your utility company) and the supply (the generators).

Thus, the electricity market must be administered by a regulatory body that monitors the demand, and tells each generator how much to supply such that the total supply exactly equals the demand at all times. It is worth it to have an organization that is different to the company or companies who own and operate the generators, because it fosters healthy competition between the generation companies, which reduces the cost of electricity.
