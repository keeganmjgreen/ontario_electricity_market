# How the Electricity Market Works

The world's electrical grids stand alongside the internet and water supply networks as great systems and accomplishments of humanity. We rely on these systems every day, yet most of us do not understand how these complex systems work. We often take these systems for granted when they are functioning correctly, which they almost always do. When such systems fail, such as during a power outage, we realize how dramatically they improve our quality of life.

The ability to flip a switch and flood a room with light in the middle of the night is the result of over a hundred years of human innovation and people working around the clock to keep the world's grids running smoothly&mdash;to literally keep the lights on. What happens every time we turn on an appliance often eludes us. Nonetheless, without fail, slightly more current gets drawn through tens or hundreds of kilometers of transmission and distribution lines. And, in tandem, the generators at the end of those transmission lines start to work slightly harder, whether in a power station or a solar or wind farm.

But even this is not a full appreciation for what goes into constantly balancing the supply and demand of electricity. The grid is just as much an economic system as a physical one, and it can be operated in a way that creates the perfect economic playing field&mdash;one that incentivizes the generation of power that is plentiful, reliable, and affordable. That playing field is the wholesale electricity market. But before we discuss the electricity market, let's look at a brief history of the grid.

## A Brief History of the Electrical Grid

The electric power industry was pioneered in the US and UK in the late 1800s and early 1900s [@tuttle2016]. Before electrical grids were established, the supply and demand of electricity had to be colocated. This was inconvenient and inefficient, so private utility companies came about to operate their own generation and distribution systems serving multiple customers [@borberly2001]. In some cases, utility companies connected their respective systems to be able to work together to meet peaks in demand. It was quickly realized that electricity systems serve the public good, and government oversight resulted in a new world order for utility companies. Around 1940 in the UK and France, nationalization resulted in the interconnection of regional grids into nationwide grids [@NT;@carrive]. And by 1960, many European countries had nationwide grids of one form or another [@schmalensee2021].

Whether owned by a private company or government organization, and whether the size of a region or of a country, electrical grids must be operated such that the supply of electricity equals the demand for electricity at all times. Otherwise, as we will learn, load shedding, brownouts, or blackouts occur. Enter the wholesale electricity market.

## Wholesale Electricity Markets

A wholesale electricity market, also known as a power exchange (PX), is a system that allows balancing supply and demand while minimizing the cost of electricity production (supply) and maximizing value to electricity consumers (demand). In a wholesale electricity market, loads participate by *bidding* to buy power, and generators participate by *offering* to sell power. A generator may be a power station (e.g., a hydroelectric power station) or a wind or solar farm. A load may be a utility company (participating in the market on behalf of its customers) or, more recently, large industrial consumers.

A central authority decides which bids and offers to accept/dispatch, or reject. Making this decision is called *clearing the market*, the objective of which is to achieve the best overall outcome for the generators and loads. Because of this objective, the market clearing process has some key requirements. Firstly, the decision must be informed by knowledge of the transmission and distribution networks, of all generators and their offers, and of all loads and their bids. The central authority must know the limits of the grid's transmission lines, otherwise they might try to transmit too much power through certain transmission lines, rather than generating locally when necessary. The second key requirement of the market clearing process is that it must be done for all generators and loads simultaneously, as part of one decision, as there is only one outcome that maximizes benefit to all generators and loads.

The only way these requirements can be met is if the decision is made by a central authority, rather than by any one generation company or utility. The central authority is usually a government-owned or government-appointed not-for-profit organization, but sometimes, especially historically and in the US, it is a privately owned and for-profit company. However, the central authority being a government organization&mdash;one that does not itself own (or have stakes in) any generators or loads&mdash;ensures that the market clearing process is unbiased. Because such an organization cannot itself earn revenue from generating electricity, it operates for the public good, not for profit. Thus, generators are paid fairly, loads are charged fairly, and both are selected for dispatch fairly. In North America, such organizations are called Independent System Operators (ISOs) because they do not own any&mdash;are independent of&mdash;generators, loads, and transmission lines. Examples include the [California ISO (CAISO)](https://www.caiso.com/) and Ontario's [Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO)](https://ieso.ca/).
